                                        <p>
                                            In the recent holiday, our team leader gave the team members a gift certificate that he received from one of our subcontractor
                                            partners.I don’t know which one that is, but since it is a gift from my superior I feel uneasy to refuse it. Would it be ok to receive it.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>
                                </a>
                                <div class="faq-content">

                                        <span>A.</span>
                                        If your team leader received the gift certificates from a subcontractor partner and then distributed those among his team members, we can say that first, he violated the
                                        Code of Conduct. However, the team members who received it is also regarded as violating the Code and therefore both should report to the Audit Team.

                                        <p>
                                            When we hold a company event, such as company track meet and hiking, we sometimes receive supporting donation (prizes,
                                            alcohol and non-alcohol beverage etc.) from our subcontractors. Is it a violation of the Code of Conduct?
                                        </p>
                                    </div>
                                </a>

                                        Receiving any form of supporting donation from subcontractor partners is a violation of the Code of Conduct. The right to way to deal with supporting donation is to explain
                                        to the giver the purpose of our ethical management and return it. We need to establish a new culture to hold the company events more modestly within the budget, and refrain
                                        from burdening the subcontractor partners by informing them of the events intentionally for such donation.

                                            My uncle was hired by one of our subcontractors, which I am in charge of. We often come across with each other at work, and
                                            when that happens, he tends to request to change the design or raise the unit prices. What should I do?
                                        </p>
                                    </div>

                                        If you think you cannot carry your tasks in a fair manner due to the situation, you should talk to your team leader or Management Guidance Team about the matter and
                                        follow their advice accordingly.

                                            After finishing the special task in the field or at night overtime, we went out for team dinner to promote the amenity among the
                                            team members or to enjoy the sense of fulfilment.In such case, what should be the proper way to handle the expenses?

                                        You should obtain the approval of the Department Manager on the expenses. If the expenses are within the budget range, it is ok.

                                        valuables for you, without telling you, and if you report it to your superior or Management Guidance Team as soon as you are aware of that, it is not a violation.

                                        <p>
                                            I had a meal with a person related to my job duties and we played a card game after that. If I got a lot of money as I won the game,
                                            against my will, is it accepting bribery?

                                        You should not exchange money or valuables, whether directly or indirectly, through card games with other work-related persons, in the first place. If absolutely necessary,
                                        regardless of the amount, you should return it to the other side.

                                            Let say, I visited one of our partner companies for inspection related to apparatus purchase. The company offered me dinner and
                                            considering what we had, it seemed to have cost more than 70,000 Won per person.What should I do?

                                        As you know, we provide our employees with travel allowances including meals, for ordinary business operation. So, try to pay for your own meal, and if possible, think in
                                        advance of a restaurant and the costs per person within a normal, ordinary range, in case the other side would treat you.

                                        We understand that it is not always easy to decline the partner companies’ offer of treatment. However, we still encourage you to do so in a polite way, and remind you that
                                        we should never receive entertainment of high price. Even if the partner companies pay for it as their business expenses, it would still influence your work for them, and is
                                        probably intended for such effect.

                                            I have known an employee of a partner company for a long time on business. As we have known each other for many years now,
                                            we have become close on personal levels.He gave me a coupon for airline tickets to Jeju Island the other day and suggested to go
                                            on a family vacation together this summer, with both of our families. How should I respond to this?

                                        The other side might have offered it genuinely for friendship, but while he deals with Dongbu account, you both should be careful not to mix professional with private action.
                                        If each party, you and the other side, pays for one’s own travel expenses, that would be, of course, fine.

                                            My closest high school alumnus is running a company that supplies to our company. We sometimes have dinner together and go
                                            for family picnics.In those occasions, my friend pays the expensive more often than I do, and I wonder if that would be a problem.

                                        Since it is a case that your high school friend has a business relationship with us, if you are in a position that may involve the supply process at any stage, it should be better that
                                        you pay for your own expenses. You can probably explain our policy of ethical management and the Code of Practical Conduct to your friend without damaging the relationship.

                                            of them paid our dinner and left before we finished. In this case, how should I handle the situation?

                                            that company.There was a high school reunion where both of us attended, and we went to a bar after the reunion and he paid
                                            the drinks. Is this a violation of the Code of Practical Conduct?

                                            The partner company requested my business travel schedule, so I sent a copy. On the very day of my business travel, their staff
                                            came to fetch me by car at Gimpo Int’l Airport from Ansan.Is this case also a violation of the Code of Practice?

                                        In our culture and tradition, making your guest feel welcome and at home is a virtue. So, their coming to the airport by car to fetch does not amount to an ethical violation.
                                        However, if you request it to the partner company and press them in any manner, it would be a violation.

                                            If a junior staff notifies the work-related personnel or partner companies of his/her superior’s family occasion without authorization
                                            of the superior, would it be a violation of the Code of Practice?

                                        The Code of Practice restricts expressly notifying the work-related personnel of one’s own family events. Notifying on behalf of one’s superior who has the family event,
                                        is also a violation of the Code.

                                            paid 100,000 Won tribute. What should I do?

                                            how is the person protected?

                                        The identification of the reporter will be kept confidential. However, in case it is disclosed, the HR will make a necessary arrangement to protect him/her against any harm,
                                        in consideration of the person’s own request as well.

                                            The company makes internal report mandatory, but if one does so, there is always a risk of causing conflicts with one’s superior
                                            or colleagues. What is the company’s solution to this?
                                        </p>
                                    </div>

                                        The company will protect the identification of the reporter strictly, prevent any conflicts among our members, and take care of the reporter so that he/she would not suffer
                                        any disadvantages. Any illegal matters of the company should be solved quickly before it becomes a bigger problem since that is the way to protect the concerned parties,
                                        including the company.

                                            I wanted to make an official report to the company concerning an environment-related accident, or violation of relevant laws,
                                            but my superior tries to understate or hide it considering the image and reputation of the company. What should I do in this case?
                                        </p>
                                    </div>

                                        If that the company attempts to understate or cover up the relevant facts becomes known to the public, Dongbu’s image of eco-friendly corporation will be damaged
                                        significantly. Therefore, if your superior tries to understate or hide the matter, you must report it to the Management Guidance Team.

                                            Even if we understand that a certain behavior would contradict the Code of Ethics (Code of Conduct and Practice incl.), it is
                                            practically impossible for a junior employee to refuse his/her superior’s order.If a junior obeys the superior’s order, is he/she
                                            also subject to punishment?

                                        If a junior employee carries out an act that contradicts the Code of Ethics (Code of Conduct and Code of Practice incl.), both his/her superior who ordered him/her to do it,
                                        and the junior employee who simply followed the order will be held responsible. Thus, even if your superior orders you to commit a violation, you decline and report to the
                                        Management Guidance Team.

                                            becomes a problem?

                                        such violation should resolve the matter voluntarily, as quickly as possible to minimize the effect.
